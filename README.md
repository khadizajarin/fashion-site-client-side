**Project Overview**
This client-side application is part of a comprehensive e-commerce platform for fashion and apparel. It includes a user-friendly website with features like product management, user authentication, a shopping cart, and product details pages. Here are some key features and information about this project:
- User-friendly interface with a navigation bar, banner, and footer, offering easy access to Home, Add Product, My Cart, and Login.
- Showcase at least six brands on the home page, each with an image and name, allowing users to explore brand-specific product offerings.
- Private/protected "Add Product" page with a form for adding products, including image, name, brand name, type, price, short description, rating, and an "Add" button.
- Dedicated brand-based product pages with sliders displaying three or more advertisement images and a selection of products, featuring image, name, brand name, type, price, rating, and buttons for details and updates.
- User-friendly product details pages with an "Add to Cart" button. Users are redirected to the login page if unauthorized. Additionally, users can view and manage their cart on the "My Cart" page, and robust user authentication is implemented, including additional login methods and password requirements. The user's profile information and a logout button are available in the navbar, and a custom 404 page handles invalid routes.
